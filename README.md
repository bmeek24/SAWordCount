To use the word count program:

1. Make sure you have groovy installed. Go here for details: (http://groovy-lang.org/install.html)
2. Add the books you would like analyzed as txt files to a folder named "books" inside the same folder containing WordCount.groovy. Three txt files and a list of "stop words" have been added to the repo already.
3. Point your terminal/command line to the folder containing "WordCount.groovy" and enter "groovy WordCount" to start the program. Follow the on-screen prompts. Enter the name of the book you would like analyzed, or Q at any time to quit.
4. To run the unit test file, enter "groovy WordCountTest" into the command, but you really shouldn't do that, because it currently doesn't work.

Thank you for your time.
